django-cors-middleware
======================

``django-cors-middleware`` is **depreciated**, please use `adamchainz/django-cors-headers <https://github.com/adamchainz/django-cors-headers>`_ instead.

It was created at a time when ``django-cors-headers`` was not maintained, but it is well maintained now and there is no need to have two different packages for that.

Extract from `adamchainz/django-cors-headers README's About section <https://github.com/adamchainz/django-cors-headers>`_:

    **django-cors-headers** was created in January 2013 by Otto Yiu. It went
    unmaintained from August 2015 and was forked in January 2016 to the package
    `django-cors-middleware <https://github.com/zestedesavoir/django-cors-middleware>`_
    by Laville Augustin at Zeste de Savoir.
    In September 2016, Adam Johnson, Ed Morley, and others gained maintenance
    responsibility for **django-cors-headers**
    (`Issue 110 <https://github.com/adamchainz/django-cors-headers/issues/110>`__)
    from Otto Yiu.
    Basically all of the changes in the forked **django-cors-middleware** were
    merged back, or re-implemented in a different way, so it should be possible to
    switch back. If there's a feature that hasn't been merged, please open an issue
    about it.
